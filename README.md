# Score-Keeper

Score Keeper is a simple game which I have implemented using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## How to play

You have to select a number between 1 and 10 in the **Playing to** input field.


Now there are three buttons at the bottom (I am not gonna explain it as I hope you are intelligent enough to find it out).


Among Player1 and Player2 (may be the same person) one who achieves the target number first by just tapping on **P1 +1** or **P2 +1** is the **LOSER.**



Ya just kidding he is the **WINNER.**  </br>
